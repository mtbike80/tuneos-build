# TuneOS Build System

This repository contains the configuration files and tooling to **build the TuneOS ISO** — a Debian 13–based distribution optimized for **audio production** and **software-defined radio (SDR)**.

---

## 🏗 What It Does

- Uses **Debian live-build** to create a bootable ISO.
- Injects TuneOS packages and branding from [tuneos-repo](https://github.com/mtbike80/tuneos-repo).
- Provides real-time optimizations for low-latency audio.
